`taxizedb` - Tools for Working with Taxonomic Databases on your machine

Docs: <https://docs.ropensci.org/taxizedb/>

[taxize](https://github.com/ropensci/taxize) is a heavily used taxonomic toolbelt
package in R - However, it makes web requests for nearly all methods. That is fine
for most cases, but when the user has many, many names it is much more efficient
to do requests to a local SQL database.

## Data sources

Not all taxonomic databases are publicly available, or possible to mash into a SQLized
version. Taxonomic DB's supported:

- NCBI: text files are provided by NCBI, which we stitch into a sqlite db
- ITIS: they provide a sqlite dump, which we use here
- The PlantList: created from stitching together csv files. this
 source is no longer updated as far as we can tell. they say they've
 moved focus to the World Flora Online
- Catalogue of Life: created from Darwin Core Archive dump.
- GBIF: created from Darwin Core Archive dump. right now we only have
 the taxonomy table (called gbif), but will add the other tables in the
 darwin core archive later
- Wikidata: aggregated taxonomy of Open Tree of Life, GLoBI and Wikidata. 
 On Zenodo, created by Joritt Poelen of GLOBI.
- World Flora Online: http://www.worldfloraonline.org/

Update schedule for databases:

- NCBI: since `db_download_ncbi` creates the database when the function
is called, it's updated whenever you run the function
- ITIS: since ITIS provides the sqlite database as a download, you can
delete the old file and run `db_download_itis` to get a new dump;
they I think update the dumps every month or so
- The PlantList: no longer updated, so you shouldn't need to download
this after the first download. hosted on Amazon S3
- Catalogue of Life: a GitHub Actions job runs once a day at 00:00 UTC,
building the lastest COL data into a SQLite database thats hosted on
Amazon S3
- GBIF: a GitHub Actions job runs once a day at 00:00 UTC,
building the lastest GBIF data into a SQLite database thats hosted on
Amazon S3
- Wikidata: last updated April 6, 2018. Scripts are available to 
update the data if you prefer to do it yourself.
- World Flora Online: since `db_download_wfo` creates the database when
the function is called, it's updated whenever you run the function

Get in touch [in the issues](https://github.com/ropensci/taxizedb/issues) with
any ideas on new data sources.

All databases are SQLite.

## Package API

This package for each data sources performs the following tasks:

* Downloaded taxonomic databases `db_download_*`
* Create `dplyr` SQL backend via `dbplyr::src_dbi` - `src_*` 
* Query and get data back into a data.frame - `sql_collect`
* Manage cached database files - `tdb_cache`
* Retrieve immediate descendents of a taxon - `children`
* Retrieve the taxonomic hierarchies from local database - `classification`
* Retrieve all taxa descending from a vector of taxa - `downstream`
* Convert species names to taxon IDs - `name2taxid`
* Convert taxon IDs to species names - `taxid2name`
* Convert taxon IDs to ranks - `taxid2rank`

You can use the `src` connections with `dplyr`, etc. to do operations downstream. Or use the database connection to do raw SQL queries.
